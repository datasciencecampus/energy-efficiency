# Energy Efficiency

This repo provides the material to support the work undertaken by the Data Science Campus to explore using machine learing to predict energy efficiency.

Specifically we explore:

* Data from Energy Performance Certificates (EPC)
* Steps needed to clean the EPC data
* Feature sets
* Machine learning models for predciting the energy efficiency

The [full report](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/projects/using-machine-learning-to-predict-energy-efficiency) gives detail on the data sets used. Please note for data security reasons it isn't possible to publish the code for everything contained with this report.

### How to use this repo
The study is implemented through a series of files that can be found in the ./01_code folder. Make sure you read the ./01_code/config-explanation.md first on how you should set up your config file, collect required data sets and name all your files.
